# What is this
This is a AI based Chess Game

# TO DO
 1. Make a playable game that choose a random move using python-chess: Done
 2. Use a NN to make the engine smart: Done
 3. Improve the chess engine so that it can consistently beat me: Under Development
 4. Make the whole this class based, and remove python-chess from it.
 5. (maybe) Do step 3, but with Reinforcement Learning, RNNs, Transformers
 5. Beat Alphazero :)

# CURRENT STAGE
    The model is overfitting a bit. But it seems reasonably easy to make it fit better.
