# What is this
This is a AI based Chess Game

# TO DO
 1. Make a playable game that choose a random move using python-chess: Done
 2. Use a NN to make the engine smart
 3. Make the whole this class based, and remove python-chess from it.
 4. (maybe) Do step 3, but with Reinforcement Learning, RNNs, Transformers
 5. Beat Alphazero :)

# CURRENT STAGE
    The primary phase of the game has been set. But the model is only giving out 8.7% accuracy over the dataset for a MLP implementation. :( 
    I think the encoder is the problem.
