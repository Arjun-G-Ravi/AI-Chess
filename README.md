# What is this
This is a AI based Chess Game

# TO DO
 1. Make a playable game that choose a random move using python-chess: Done
 2. Use a NN to make the engine smart: Done
 3. Improve the chess engine so that it can consistently beat me: **Under Development**
 4. Make the whole this class based, and remove python-chess from it.
 5. (maybe) Do step 3, but with Reinforcement Learning, RNNs, Transformers
 5. Beat Alphazero :)

# CURRENT STAGE
The model is overfitting a bit. But it seems reasonably easy to make it fit better.

 - The model wouldn't know how to win. So make the normalisation of inp, out better
 - Make a ui to test better
 - Make the encoding better ?
 - Train a larger model
