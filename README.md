# What is this
This is a AI based Chess Game

# TO DO
 - 1. Make a playable game that choose a random move using python-chess
 - 2. Use a NN to make the engine smart
 - 3. Make the whole this class based, and remove python-chess from it.
 - 4. (maybe) Do step 3, but with Reinforcement Learning, RNNs, Transformers
 - 5. Beat Alphazero :)
