# What is this
This is a AI based Chess Game

# Dataset used
https://www.kaggle.com/code/gabrielhaselhurst/chess-dataset/input

# Right now
 - The model can play chess, but is very bad
 - Recreated the whole thing using pytorch
 - The encoding works, but is not very good
 - Normalised the encodings


# Currently Doing

 - The model wouldn't know how to win. 
 - Make a ui to test better
 - Make the encoding better ?


# To do
 1. Make a playable game that choose a random move using python-chess: Done
 2. Use a NN to make the engine smart: Done
 3. Improve the chess engine so that it can consistently beat me: **Under Development**
 4. Make the whole this class based, and remove python-chess from it.
 5. (maybe) Do step 3, but with Reinforcement Learning, RNNs, Transformers
 5. Beat Alphazero :)
